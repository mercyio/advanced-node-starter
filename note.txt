CACHING :
catching is a very easy way improve the "read" performance of our application.

Anytime we refresh a page in our browser, we are issuing two request to the db.

The browser first visits the site , then the app loads in the browser. the app makes a request to the backend to figure out who the current user is and also retrieve a list of items that belongs to the user.

The request is received by our express api, the it sends the request to the respective route handler

Then the route handlers sees the incoming request and uses the mongoose library to reach out to mongodb and retrieves some amount of information
